# Lurkify
Console-based discord bot that allows you to read messages from a selected server ; channel. Made for my own entertainment.

This can be considered a breach of privacy, please do not use it to spy and seek your vendetta against somebody, it's just a silly project.

Sorts the output by timestamps to simulate an actual chat-log.

# SetUp

Install **required libraries** such as [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) and [DiscordPY](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

After ensuring the installation of neccessary imports head over to the script code and edit last line with your own private bot-token.
